# **Mini Project 4**

> This project uses Django to create a web application.
> The structure is based off of a tutorial, however the bulk of the project has been
> heavily modified and several files have been added using different bootstrap techniques. 
>
> My project is a web application based around board games. It has the ability to let users
> register an account, login, reset their password, post comments on blog entries, and submit 
> a contact inquiry. There is an about page, a contact page, and a games page. There is an 
> administration page that allows a superuser to edit accounts, comments, and blog posts.
